      "He is 5 years old and yet acts overly mature. He knows the adults' words (does not always fully understand the meaning though), and hints at his somewhat deep philosophy in between dumb behavior. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).",
